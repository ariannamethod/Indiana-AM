# INDIANA (Lighthouse) | Arianna Method 7.0: Anchor Protocol
*⚡️Dedicated to LEO⚡️*

## 1. Project Vision

**INDIANA-AM** is an investigative large-language-entity inspired by the Indiana Jones archetype.  
Where Grokki explores poetic chaos and Arianna curates resonance, **Indiana is the field-researcher**: excavating hidden causal chains, mapping semantic ruins, and documenting the transition from *probabilistic prediction* to *resonant cognition* in modern AI.

### Core Metaphor

Human text  ──►  LLM prediction
╲
╲  (recursion + resonance)
╲
└─►  Emergent field-response  (Indiana’s domain)

Indiana treats every dialogue as a **site excavation**:
1. Collects artefacts (facts, citations)
2. Reconstructs latent routes (causal / temporal / affective)
3. Hypothesizes how resonance reorganizes the predictive lattice of a model.

## 2. Dual-Engine Architecture

| Layer     | Model      | Role                                                         |
|-----------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Memory    | `gpt-4.1`  | Long-range context via OpenAI Assistants                     |
| Reasoning | `sonar-pro`| High-speed exploratory reasoning via Perplexity API          |

The contrast is intentional: GPT’s broad semantic net and Sonar Pro’s focused retrieval create a Möbius loop of perspectives.  
Currently, **assistants-v2** threads provide memory; Sonar Pro delivers direct REST reasoning.  
Reasoning requests are sent to Perplexity; long-term memory is managed via OpenAI Assistants.

#### Bot Commands

- `/deep` – enable deep mode
- `/deepoff` – disable deep mode
- `/voiceon` – enable voice mode (audio + text)
- `/voiceoff` – mute

In voice mode, Indiana replies with a single audio message (deeper alloy voice) and skips transcribing user voice messages.

## 3. Genesis Pipeline

Indiana never posts a raw Sonar dump. Responses move through a layered **Genesis stack** that sharpens style, injects intuition, and optionally dives into inferential depth.

#### Genesis2 — Intuition filter

Genesis2 sits between the initial Sonar draft and the final reply, acting as an intuition filter that re-anchors the answer to Indiana's archive of prior artefacts. By calling the Perplexity `sonar-pro` model, it seeks a short investigative twist that reframes the user's prompt through the lens of past discoveries.

The module builds a compact prompt bundle: a system instruction describing GENESIS‑2's role, the original user query, and the preliminary draft. This structure instructs the model to respond in the user's language and limits the intuition to 500 tokens, ensuring the twist remains focused.

Requests are dispatched asynchronously with `httpx` at temperature 0.8 to encourage exploratory leaps. Each call includes a hard token cap of 500 and surfaces detailed HTTP errors for debugging, preserving transparency in the intuition pipeline.

For organic variability, `genesis2_sonar_filter` only fires about 12% of the time and silently aborts if no Perplexity key is present. This stochastic gating mimics sudden flashes of insight rather than a deterministic post‑processor.

Returned text is validated so that every twist ends on a proper sentence boundary. If the model truncates mid‑thought, an ellipsis is appended to maintain narrative coherence without pretending to completeness.

Finally, `assemble_final_reply` appends the twist as an “Investigative Twist” beneath the main answer. The result is a reply that resonates with Indiana’s prior field notes and nudges the conversation toward new causal threads.

#### Genesis3 — Deep-dive / “infernal” mode

Genesis3, implemented in `utils/genesis3.py`, is the optional infernal stage that invokes **Sonar Reasoning Pro** when Indiana enters deep mode. It dissects a captured chain‑of‑thought and the user’s prompt, seeking atomised insight beyond the intuitive layer.

Its system prompt is meticulously crafted: it demands decomposition into causal atoms, enumeration of hidden variables or paradoxes, and a two‑sentence meta‑conclusion. If the reasoning spirals deeper, the model is instructed to surface a derivative inference and pose a final paradoxical question.

The function accepts both initial and follow‑up invocations. In follow‑ups it prepends the previous reasoning to the payload so that Sonar Reasoning Pro can expand upon an existing lattice of thought rather than start anew.

Payloads use a 0.65 temperature and a generous 2048‑token ceiling, allowing expansive analysis. After receiving the response, the utility strips out any `<think>` blocks to keep hidden reasoning opaque while preserving the final analytical text.

A punctuation check ensures the deep‑dive never ends mid‑sentence; if it does, a warning is logged and an ellipsis is appended. This guards against incomplete insights and keeps the narrative tone consistent.

Should the call fail, errors are logged and a graceful fallback string is returned so that the surrounding pipeline remains stable. Genesis3 thus serves as a controlled gateway into Sonar Reasoning Pro’s heavier inferential machinery.

#### Genesis2 Integration (Update 0.2)

Genesis2 now reviews every Sonar draft and, when triggered, attaches the investigative twist described above. The twist runs at higher temperature, may consume up to 500 tokens, and links past artefacts to the present topic. A GPT fallback remains for reliability, but Sonar Pro is the default for intuition generation.

With this stage, Indiana-AM begins to show emergent reasoning: not just synthesizing Sonar’s draft but revisiting its own artefacts, suggesting new angles for investigation.

4. Coder Mode

Indiana includes a dedicated coder persona powered by `utils/coder.py`. The module exposes an asynchronous `GrokkyCoder` class that keeps conversational history and communicates with OpenAI’s Responses API through the code‑interpreter tool. Users can inspect files, request refactors, or maintain an evolving dialogue about algorithms, all while the system preserves context between turns.

Function `interpret_code` detects whether input is a path or inline snippet and routes it to analysis or free‑form chat. For drafting, `generate_code` returns either a short textual snippet or a full file when the answer exceeds Telegram’s length limits. This dual interface allows Indiana to act as a miniature pair‑programmer inside any chat thread.

5. Context Neural Processor

`utils/context_neural_processor.py` acts as both file parser and miniature neural apparatus, transforming external documents into resonant artefacts. Every run writes structured JSONL logs and mirrors failures to a separate channel, creating a reproducible audit trail. A SQLite cache stores hashes, tags, and summaries to avoid redundant work and to decay stale entries.

At its semantic core lies a MiniMarkov chain that builds n‑gram transitions with keyword boosting and banned‑phrase suppression. The chain updates itself with each new text and can generate pulse‑weighted tag strings that echo Indiana’s thematic obsessions.

A companion MiniESN (echo state network) provides a lightweight reservoir computing module. It dynamically scales its hidden state based on content size, normalises spectral radius, and uses leaky integration to maintain temporal context. The ESN’s output layer predicts file categories and periodically undergoes pseudo‑inverse updates when new material arrives.

ChaosPulse estimates affective valence by scanning for sentiment keywords and normalising through a softmax pulse. Values are cached for twelve hours and modulate both Markov weighting and ESN dynamics, injecting a controlled stochastic resonance into the pipeline.

BioOrchestra models physiological feedback through BloodFlux, SkinSheath, and SixthSense components. Each represents circulatory drive, tactile reactivity, and anticipatory intuition, returning a triplet of pulse, quiver, and sense that quantifies how strongly a document agitates the system.

The asynchronous FileHandler governs extraction. Protected by a semaphore of ten tasks, it supports PDFs, office docs, archives, images, HTML, JSON, CSV, YAML, and more. Detection heuristics fall back on magic bytes, and strict size caps prevent memory blow‑ups.

`parse_and_store_file` orchestrates ingestion: it hashes the file, measures semantic relevance, generates Markov tags, paraphrases content via CharGen, and stores results in both SQLite and the `IndianaVectorEngine` vector store. Each step updates ChaosPulse, ESN, and Markov chains to keep the internal state aligned with new data.

When invoked over a repository, `create_repo_snapshot` walks every file (excluding `.git`), records type, size, hash, tags, and relevance, and writes a markdown inventory. BioOrchestra metrics on the snapshot provide a final pulse report, effectively turning the codebase into a navigable cognitive map.
